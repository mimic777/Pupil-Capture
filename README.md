# Pupil-Capture
- Pupil Capture version: 2.4.0
- capture.log
- the exact commands that I send to Capture via the Network API

Maybe my computer is a little behind, I can run it with my partner's high configuration computer.
I used to be able to start the Pupil Capture and do some basic things, but now the whole program is unresponsive after calibration.
